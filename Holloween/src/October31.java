	 * 	Another way to initialize an array with a list of values the same time when its declared is as follows
	 *    int[] squares = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 }; this initializes squares to refer to a newly created array that contain the values defined in the list
	 *   A list initializer of this form can be used only in a declaration statement !
	 */
	
	/*
	 * However, there is another, similar notation for creating a new array that can be used in other places
	 * The following notation uses another form of the new operator to be able to create both a new array object and to fill it in with the values provided
	 * supposed the variable cubes already has been initialized already and we wanted to assign a new values to it we can do so by:
	 * 		cubes = new int[] {1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343}; // this is an assignment statement rather than a declaration so if we don't
	 * 															// use the new int[] syntax our code will not be vaild
	 */
	
	/*
	 * 	The syntax for the new operator is as follow's:
	 * 		new <base-type> [] { <list-of-values> } // this expression takes in the value of a reference to a newly created array object, in this sense
	 * 											// its just an array literal, since it's just something that we can type in a program to represent a value
	 * 											// This means that it can be used in any context where it takes in an object of type <base-type> [].
	 *  // for example we could pass in a newly created array as an actual parameter to a subroutine
