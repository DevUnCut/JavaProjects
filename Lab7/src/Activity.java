/*
 The Activity class should only contain the ActivityHeader
 and the ActivityEntry []
 	
 	public class Activity
• ActivityHeader
• ActivityEntry []
 	
 	
 	Create these two fields
 	- ActivityHeader
	the ActivityHeader should fill up a header like mailing a letter
	except for our case we just want to fill in a creation time stamp
	and the name of the activity and we can start that like this
	
	public class ActivityHeader
		- CreationStimeStamp i
		- ActivityName
	
	- ActivityEntry []
	the ActivityEntry field should tell us about the activity
	we just did and we can start with something like this
	
		public class ActivityEntry
			- Entry timestamp
			- Enrtry duration
			- Entry description
